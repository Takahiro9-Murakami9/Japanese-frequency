Developed in the 1980s, it's free to use and runs on multiple operating systems. Its key features include ACID transaction support, advanced indexing, and query optimization.

[^3]:Python was first released in 1991 by Guido van Rossum and has since become one of the most popular programming languages in use today. It's used for a wide range of applications, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more.
