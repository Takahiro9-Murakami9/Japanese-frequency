# This app can analyze text and provide words frequencies and English translations!

## introduction

When learning a language, don't you think it's important to know how often certain vocabulary is used in a particular genre of text? For example, studying vocabulary with high frequency of occrence in the field of economics would be more efficient. This app provides users with the frequency of vocabulary and its English translations in Japanese text entered by user.

## Getting started

Before setup, please install Visual Studio Code[^1], PostgreSQL[^2], and Python. Installing the Python extension in Visual Studio Code allows you to use Python within the IDE, which is very convenient.

[^1]:Visual Studio Code is a source-code editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux, and macOS. It is a popular tool for developers due to its lightweight design and wide range of features, such as debugging, code navigation, and extension support.

[^2]:PostgreSQL is a powerful open-source relational database management system known for its stability, scalability, and extensibility. Developed in the 1980s, it's free to use and runs on multiple operating systems. Its key features include ACID transaction support, advanced indexing, and query optimization.
